Agent handler — EdgeOne Makers
========================================

The file path agents/chat/index.py is auto-mapped to **POST /chat**.
(EdgeOne Makers convention: directory name = route name, `index` is the default entry.)

`context` contract:
    context.request.body    — dict, request body
    context.request.signal  — asyncio.Event, set when /chat/stop is called
    context.conversation_id — conversation ID
    context.run_id          — run ID for this invocation
    context.store           — EdgeOne built-in store; provides openai_session() and friends

# from what the user pasted in, and every answer ends with a machine-parseable
# JSON reasoning chain that the frontend's ReasoningChainPanel renders.
#
# NOTE: Apodex does not support custom function calling (`tools`/`tool_choice`)
# or `response_format`/`json_schema` structured output — the reasoning-chain
# contract below is enforced entirely through prompting, not API features.

    #     (see cloud-functions/conversations/index.py and history/index.py)
    #     and surfaces a duplicated user message in OpenAI Agents SDK traces
    #     because the SDK's session.get_items() will re-feed it as input
    #     alongside the new `message` argument.
    #   - We therefore probe with get_messages(limit=1); if the conversation
    #     already has any record, the index is established and we skip.
    #
    # The /history route already filters by metadata.agent_sdk_session and
